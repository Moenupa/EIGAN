For Sayan -- clean up the following codes
1. result_eval.ipynb: remove cells after cell 61
		understand data format and model architecture

2. train_evaluate.ipynb:
		use code to visualize new data generated from trained gan

3. generative_model.py:
		give them class definition

4. Process-data.y
		transforms data into torch/numpy objects and scales for training...
